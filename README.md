# 30 Day Chart Challenge, April 2022

This repository has the code, data, and brief documentation for my charts for the \#30DayChartChallenge in 2022. I'm currently planning to make most of these charts in R with `ggplot2`, because that's what I want to learn to use better. But if something else is really the right tool for the chart in question, I'll use that.

## Themes and Topics

The challenge is organized into five six-day themes, with daily prompts. The themes are Comparisons, Distributions, Relationships, Time Series, and Uncertainties. The full list of prompts, and the charts I chose to create for them, is below. The last prompt in each theme is targeted toward a particular data source or publication.
